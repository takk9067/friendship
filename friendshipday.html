<p><font size="4" font face="arial" color=""><i>Friendship Day (also known as International Friendship Day or Friend's Day) is a day in several countries for celebrating friendship. It was initially promoted by the greeting cards' industry; evidence from social networking sites shows a revival of interest in the holiday that may have grown with the spread of the internet, particularly in India, Bangladesh, and Malaysia. Mobile phones, digital communication and social media have contributed to popularize the custom. Those who promote the holiday in South Asia attribute the tradition of dedicating a day in honour of friends to have originated in the United States in 1935.<i></></font></br>

<p><font size="4" font face="arial" color="black"><i>Friendship day was first proposed in Paraguay in 1958 by Joyce Hall. It was a holiday involving the celebration of friendships through a global holiday. The original Date Of Celebration was August 2nd, though it has since been moved to August 7th due to de-synchronization in the United States[2]

In honor of Friendship Day in 1998, Nane Annan, wife of UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, named Winnie the Pooh as the world's Ambassador of Friendship at the United Nations. The event was co-sponsored by the U.N. Department of Public Information and Disney Enterprises, and was co-hosted by Kathy Lee Gifford.[3]

The idea of a Global Friendship Day was first proposed on July 20th, 1958, by Dr. Ramon Artemio Bracho during a dinner with friends in Puerto Pinasco, a town on the River Paraguay about 200 miles north of Asuncion, Paraguay.[4]

During said meeting, the World Friendship Crusade was born. The World Friendship Crusade is a foundation that promotes friendship and fellowship among all human beings, regardless of race, color or religion. Since then, July 30th has been ferverently celebrated as Friendship Day in Paraguay every year and has also been adopted by several other countries.[5]

The World Friendship Crusade has lobbied the United Nations for several years to recognise July 30th as World Friendship Day and finally in 2011, the General Assembly of the United Nations decided to designate the 30th of July as the International Day of Friendship; and would proceed to invite all the Member States to observe the International Day of Friendship in accordance with the culture and customs of their local, national and regional communities, including through education and public awareness-raising activities.<i></p></font></br>

The United Nations finally declared July 30 as the official International Friendship Day. In India; however, it is usually celebrated on the first Sunday of the month of August.<i></></font><br>

<p><font size="4" font face="arial"color="black"><i>Our world faces many challenges, crises and forces of division — such as poverty, violence, and human rights abuses — among many others — that undermine peace, security, development and social harmony among the world's peoples.
To confront those crises and challenges, their root causes must be addressed by promoting and defending a shared spirit of human solidarity that takes many forms — the simplest of which is friendship.
Through friendship — by accumulating bonds of camaraderie and developing strong ties of trust — we can contribute to the fundamental shifts that are urgently needed to achieve lasting stability, weave a safety net that will protect us all, and generate passion for a better world where all are united for the greater good.<i></p></font></br>
